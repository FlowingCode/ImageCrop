# Image Crop Add-on

Component for cropping images. Wrapper for React component [react-image-crop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-crop).

## Features

The component allows to crop images and configure the following properties for a customized crop:
* crop dimensions (unit, x and y coordinates, width, and height) 
* aspect ratio (for example, 1 for a square or 16/9 for landscape)
* circular crop (selection are has circular shape)
* keep selection (selection can't be disabled if the user clicks outside the selection area)
* disabled (cannot resize or draw a new crop)
* locked (cannot create or resize a crop, but can still drag the existing crop around)
* min width (minimum crop width)
* min height (minimum crop height)
* max width (maximum crop width)
* max height (maximum crop height)
* rule of thirds (to show rule of thirds lines in the cropped area)

The cropped image result can be obtain as a URI using `getCroppedImageDataUri` method
or as a Base64 encoded byte array by using `getCroppedImageBase64` method.

# Developer Guide

## Getting started

* Basic use

```java
Image image = new Image("images/empty-plant.png", "image to crop");  
ImageCrop imageCrop = new ImageCrop(image);
add(imageCrop);
```

* Get cropped image 

```java
Image croppedImage = new Image(imageCrop.getCroppedImageDataUri(), "cropped image")
```

## Special configuration when using Spring

By default, Vaadin Flow only includes ```com/vaadin/flow/component``` to be always scanned for UI components and views. For this reason, the add-on might need to be allowed in order to display correctly. 

To do so, just add ```com.flowingcode``` to the ```vaadin.allowed-packages``` property in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```, like:

```vaadin.allowed-packages = com.vaadin,org.vaadin,dev.hilla,com.flowingcode```
 
More information on Spring scanning configuration [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/integrations/spring/configuration/#configure-the-scanning-of-packages).
